# FASoC Database

## Populate DB with json files
Fasoc Database is a MongoDB atlas cloud instance.
In order to insert/populate new records into the DB, please follow the steps below:

Run insert_json_cloud.py by writing `./insert_json_cloud.py` in the terminal while you have navigated to `fasoc/database`. `--filename` indicates the argument for the path to the json file to insert in the DB. Please see the Makefile as an example to run.
